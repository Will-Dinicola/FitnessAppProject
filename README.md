This project was created using **React** for the frontend, **Flask** for the backend, and **MySQL (via Railway)** for the database, to create a fitness tracker and incentivizer to help users achieve their goals.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Running the DB

### Create a **_.env_** file in the fitness-backend folder (same location as app.py) & insert the code:

_to create the .env file, just create a new file and call it .env_

**CODE:**

DB_HOST=your-db-host

DB_PORT=your-db-port

DB_USER=your-db-user

DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password

DB_NAME=FitnessAppDB


_Please contact Nhi for the information on the DB._


### Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Connect to SQL Server:

1. Navigate to fitness-backend folder
2. enter the mysql command: mysql -h caboose.proxy.rlwy.net -P 53416 -u root -p --ssl=OFF railway
3. enter password
4. YOU'RE IN!
